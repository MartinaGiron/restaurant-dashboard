# Project Overview:
This project focuses on creating a Streamlit Dashboard that provides an overview on a dataset containing restaurant visitor information. The dataset is compiled from two platforms:

Hot Pepper Gourmet (hpg): A restaurant search and reservation platform, similar to Yelp.
AirREGI / Restaurant Board (air): A reservation control and cash register system, similar to Square.
The dataset includes reservation data, visitor counts, and other related information, with the goal of understanding patterns in restaurant visitors and reservations.
